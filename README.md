**Yummy Yummy In My Tummy** is a lightweight Python tool to manage and explore a collection of recipes.

- `main.py` — main script / entry point  
- `utils/` — directory for utility modules  

## Features

- Load and parse recipes from a JSON file  
- (Future) Filter recipes by ingredient, cooking time, or other criteria  
- (Future) Export or format recipes in different output modes (e.g. text, Markdown)
- (Future) Standardisation of ingredients for recipe-importing feature
